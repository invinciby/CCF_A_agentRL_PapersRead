  "summary": "本类别研究如何通过设计外部奖励或激励机制，在不确定其他智能体学习动态的情况下，引导多智能体系统朝向期望的策略或行为。区别于传统的多智能体协同或竞争，它侧重于一个中央引导者（如平台、机制设计者）如何主动施加影响来塑造群体行为。代表性工作考虑了更一般的“马尔可夫智能体”学习动态，并采用基于模型的非回合制强化学习来学习历史依赖的引导策略，以处理对智能体学习动态的模型不确定性。该方向在经济学、自动驾驶、机器人集群控制等领域有广泛应用，旨在实现高效、低成本的系统级目标。",

      "title": "Learning to Steer Markovian Agents under Model Uncertainty",
      "abstract": "Designing incentives for an adapting population is a ubiquitous problem in a wide array of economic applications and beyond. In this work, we study how to design additional rewards to steer multi-agent systems towards desired policies \\emph{without} prior knowledge of the agents' underlying learning dynamics. Motivated by the limitation of existing works, we consider a new and general category of learning dynamics called \\emph{Markovian agents}. We introduce a model-based non-episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation for our steering problem. Importantly, we focus on learning a \\emph{history-dependent} steering strategy to handle the inherent model uncertainty about the agents' learning dynamics. We introduce a novel objective function to encode the desiderata of achieving a good steering outcome with reasonable cost. Theoretically, we identify conditions for the existence of steering strategies to guide agents to the desired policies. Complementing our theoretical contributions, we provide empirical algorithms to approximately solve our objective, which effectively tackles the challenge in learning history-dependent strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical evaluations.",
